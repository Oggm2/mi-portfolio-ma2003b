## Comparative Table of the Three Methods

| Aspect                | Factor Analysis                  | Discriminant Analysis                        | Cluster Analysis             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Type of Learning      | Unsupervised                     | Supervised                                    | Unsupervised                 |
| Main Objective        | Dimensionality reduction         | Classification                                 | Segmentation                 |
| Required Input        | Continuous variables             | Categorical target + predictor variables       | Continuous variables         |
| Main Output           | Latent factors                   | Discriminant functions                         | Groups / clusters            |
| Ideal Use Case        | Identify underlying hidden structures in many variables | Predict group membership for new observations | Group similar observations without labels |
| Limitations           | Requires large sample size; subjective interpretation of factors | Assumes normality and equal covariance (for LDA) | Sensitive to scaling; number of clusters must be chosen |
